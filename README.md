# Causality-for-Mechanistic-Interpretability
This repository features research papers focused on achieving mechanistic interpretability through causality. By leveraging causal reasoning, these studies aim to unravel how specific components in AI models contribute to decision-making processes, enhancing transparency and reliability in AI systems.

2. [Ablation-Based Methods](#ablation-based-methods)

## Patch-Based Methods
Causal interpretability through interventions that patch or modify parts of the model.

## Ablation-Based Methods
Causal interpretability using ablation techniques, where parts of the model are removed or deactivated to study their effects.
